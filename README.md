# build
A TypeScript class named BARK NFT that builds, optimizes, and optionally serializes &amp; base64 encodes a Solana transaction, we'll use the @solana/web3.js library. The class will allow for constructing a transaction, optimizing it by compressing the instructions (if possible), and providing options to serialize and encode the transaction.
